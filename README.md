- ⚡ Fun fact: Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee. Legend has it that a goat herder named Kaldi discovered
                the energizing effects of coffee beans after noticing his goats became lively and energetic after eating
               the berries from a certain tree. Kaldi shared his discovery with monks, who then used the berries to make
               a drink to help them stay awake during long prayers. This early form of coffee consumption eventually spread throughout
               Ethiopia and beyond, leading to the global coffee culture we know today.
